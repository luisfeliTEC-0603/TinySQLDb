# TinySQLDb
Simple relational database management system designed for educational purposes. The project involves implementing a basic database engine in C# that supports a subset of SQL commands through a client-server architecture.

## Components
- **Client**: A PowerShell module that allows users to input SQL queries through the command line. It sends queries to the database engine via sockets and displays the results in a tabular format in the console.
- **Server**: Multi-layered system designed to handle SQL queries from clients efficiently and reliably.
